# The GAP package LINS

This package provides an algorithm for computing the normal subgroups of a finitely presented group up to some given index bound.

This algorithm is based on work of Derek Holt and David Firth.
Derek Holt and David Firth implemented this algorithm in the algebra software MAGMA.
The current implementation in GAP uses a table of groups that was computed by Derek Holt.
