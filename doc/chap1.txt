  [33X[0;0YThis  package  provides an algorithm for computing the normal subgroups of a
  finitely presented group up to some given index bound.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThis  algorithm  is  based on work of Derek Holt and David Firth. Derek Holt
  and  David  Firth  implemented this algorithm in the algebra software MAGMA.
  The  current  implementation in GAP uses a table of groups that was computed
  by Derek Holt.[133X
